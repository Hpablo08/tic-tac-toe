## Overview
This application is a chance for students to build a Tic-Tac-Toe app that allow users to play a game of tic-tac-toe. This Solo Challenge gave us a chance to show where we are with the foundational concepts of the Mod 1 curriculum. In this challenge, we utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional app that will use game logic to play a game. I used the data model to display and update the DOM.


## Setup
- Clone this repository down to your local machine
- Navigate into the tic-tac-toe directory
- Run open index.html in the terminal to interact with the application
